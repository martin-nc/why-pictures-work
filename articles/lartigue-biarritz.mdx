This is one of my favourite pictures by Jacques-Henri Lartigue (1894-1986). I love the energy and spontaneity, and the thrill you feel for the woman who's leaping over the surf. It's a surprising picture, too, because you don't expect exuberance in an Edwardian photo.

Let's see what gives the picture impact.

## Clear subject

If we reduce the tones to three, we see how strong the subject is (*Fig 1*). Her dark, plain coat silhouettes her against the sea. There are no boats out at sea, no people playing in the waves and no rocks on the sand to distract us. The picture can only be about the woman.

## Diagonals and direction

Diagonals give energy to a picture, and she's running with such energy her coat and dress are flying back at 45 degrees (*Fig 2*). These lines make our eyes travel at an angle that slices the horizontals of the waves and horizon. She's slightly off-centre, too, as if she's dashing too fast for the photographer to centre her.

There's also a contrast in direction. The sea is sweeping towards us and maybe we feel a frisson inside that says "Uh oh - that sea's coming towards me!" We relive that thrill of watching the surf rushing to our feet. But the woman is running perpendicular to that direction, and along the surf. It's the most risky and exciting direction because she constantly needs to be watching and leaping to avoid getting wet.

## Blur

Only her right arm and part of her skirt are in focus. The blur around her knee and coat tail suggests the speed she's moving and the foam in the sea has dissolved into streaks pointing towards us. We know from how cameras work that this means speed - faster than a camera shutter speed. It imparts the excitement of movement, of unpredictability and danger.

## Contrast in clothes and behaviour

What's surprising about this picture is the contrast between the woman's heavy dark coat and the agility of her movement. It's as if society and fashion creates one person, but faced with the excitement of the sea another person springs out. The sea is the catalyst that brings childhood excitement to adult life. That's why I enjoy the picture.

Imagine someone had made a sculpture of this woman running along the beach, in exactly this pose. Then imagine Lartigue had photographed this sculpture. Would the picture have been as powerful? No, because we don't empathise with sculptures. We empathise with the woman, and feel som of the thrill she feels racing across the beach.

## Photographer's intent

Lartigue took this photo when he was 11 years old. It wasn't taken to sell or to shock or to exemplify his skill in a photographic genre like landscape or portrait photography. It is just photography for the fun of it, and for the love of capturing family and friends enjoying themselves.

Lartigue retained this naivety and sense of the magical throughout his life, even after becoming famous, and that's why his work is so refreshing.

<h2 className="mt-0 text-magenta">Lessons</h2>

    * If you have a single subject make it stand out. Use tone or colour contrast with a simple background.
    * Use blur to create a sense of movement and energy. Don't worry about perfect focus.
    * Catch your subject being enthusiastic, and their energy will radiate from the picture. Don't let the person or animal feel like a sculpture.
    * A person's face doesn't need to be in the picture, even if they are the subject.
    * Take your camera everywhere and catch people doing ordinary things that aren't normally seen in photos.

I don't have many pictures of people leaping across the waves, but here's one of my daughter Georgina. This picture has less energy than Lartigue's because:

    * Georgie is not moving across the camera. She's hopping up above a small wave, so the movement is modest. I should have caught her running along the surf rather than into it.
    * She isn't wearing long, flowing clothes that express movement.
    * There isn't much blur around her or the sea.

When I was cropping this picture I noticed what an odd format Lartigue's is. It's a narrow portrait format, like you've glimpsed the woman on the beach through a missing slat in a fence. This crops out any distractions around her.
