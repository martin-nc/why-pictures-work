This is one of my favourite pictures by Jacques-Henri Lartigue (1894-1986). I love the energy and spontaneity, and the thrill you feel for the woman who's leaping over the surf. It's a surprising picture, too, because you don't expect exuberance in an Edwardian photo.

Let's see what gives the picture impact.

## Clear subject

If we reduce the tones to three, we see how strong the subject is (Fig 1). Her dark, plain coat silhouettes her against the sea. There are no boats out at sea, no people playing in the waves and no rocks on the sand to distract us. The picture can only be about the woman.

## Diagonals and direction

Diagonals give energy to a picture, and she's running with such energy her coat and dress are flying back at 45 degrees (Fig 2). These lines make our eyes travel at an angle that slices the horizontals of the waves and horizon. She's slightly off-centre, too, as if she's dashing too fast for the photographer to centre her.

There's also a contrast in direction. The sea is sweeping towards us and maybe we feel a frisson inside that says "Uh oh - that sea's coming towards me!" We relive that thrill of watching the surf rushing to our feet. But the woman is running perpendicular to that direction, and along the surf. It's the most risky and exciting direction because she constantly needs to be watching and leaping to avoid getting wet.
